## Introduction ## 
Welcome to my website. This website serves as a portfolio containing links to all of work for my final project. My final project was to analyze the Online Coins of the Roman Empire database for connections between authorities and what they chose to print on coins. The video linked below goes through a few examples of how the programs on this website can be used to provide questions and useful information, though the possibilities are endless. Feel free to download and do whatever you please with the Scala 2.12 programs linked below.
