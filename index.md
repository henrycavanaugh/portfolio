## Introduction ## 
Welcome to my website. It serves as a digital portfolio containing links to all of my work for my final project. My final project was to analyze the 50,000+ coins in the Online Coins of the Roman Empire database for connections between emperors/authorities and the symbols that they chose to display on the reverse side of their coins. The video linked below gives an overview of the project in addition to a few examples of how the programs can be used to provide both questions and information about these coins and emperors. Feel free to download and do whatever you please with the Scala 2.12 programs linked at the bottom of this page.
